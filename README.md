-  Hi, I’m @jacksonSmall
-  I’m interested in Data Science, Statistics, Data Visualization, and using predicative machine learning models! 
-  I’m currently learning about Convolutional Neural Networks, Statistics, and Data Science.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on any projects related to my repositories or ones that will further my understanding of Data Science.
-  Please feel free to reach me at jacksonSmall@ucf.edu if you have further questions. Nice meeting you!
